                    <p>Suddenly, two square pictures pop on the screen. He knows the drill &mdash; his eyes dart towards a picture of a boat, and he wills his gaze to make something happen.</p>

                    <p>Like magic, the other picture disappears. A few drops of sweet apple juice, precisely measured, surge through a maze of tubing. Victor, who hasn’t had anything to drink yet today, slurps down his reward.</p>
